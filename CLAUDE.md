# MealPlan+ — Android Project Context

## What this app does
Offline-first meal planning and food logging app. Users log meals by slot (BREAKFAST / LUNCH / DINNER), track health metrics, browse/create diets, get shopping lists, and receive smart notifications when they haven't logged a meal yet.

---

## Module layout
| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `android/` | Android app (Kotlin, Compose, Room, Hilt) — primary focus |
| `shared/` | Kotlin Multiplatform library shared with iOS (SQLDelight, Ktor) |
| `ios/` | iOS SwiftUI app consuming the shared KMP framework |
| `backend/` | Spring Boot 3.2.5 REST API; Firebase JWKS auth, Neon.tech Postgres |

## Android architecture
**MVVM + Repository + Hilt DI**, following Google's Now in Android guidelines.

```
Compose UI  →  @HiltViewModel  →  Repository  →  Room DAO / Retrofit
                 StateFlow                         Flow<T>
```

- **ViewModels** — `@HiltViewModel`, expose `StateFlow<XxxState>` data classes, use `viewModelScope`
- **Repositories** — `@Singleton`, return `Flow<T>` for reactive observation, suspend funs for writes
- **Room** — 16 entities (v27 target), explicit migrations only (no destructive fallback ever), schema exported to `android/schemas/`. Full schema documented in `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`.
- **Compose** — Material 3, dynamic color, single-Activity (`MainActivity`), `NavHost` for all navigation
- **DataStore** — all user preferences (theme, notifications); shared `"settings"` store in `ThemePreferences.kt`

## Database design

See `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` for the full schema, ER diagram, slot resolution algorithm, and migration history.

### Key design decisions
- **`slotType` lives in `diet_slots` / `planned_slots`, not on `Meal`** — a meal is a reusable food collection; which slot it fills is context, not identity.
- **`user_id` only where strictly needed** — `day_plans`, `daily_logs`, `health_metrics`, `grocery_lists`. Meals and diets are app-global.
- **Planning vs Logging are separate** — `day_plans`/`planned_slots` = intent; `daily_logs`/`logged_foods` = reality. Streak uses logs only.
- **All dates stored as `Long` (epoch milliseconds at midnight UTC).** Use `LocalDate.toEpochMs()` and `Long.toLocalDate()` from `util/DateUtils.kt`.
- **System foods re-seeded by version** (`DataStore` key `systemFoodsVersion`). Uses safe upsert — never deletes existing food rows (preserves FK refs from `meal_foods` and `logged_foods`).

---

## Hard rules — never break these

1. **No destructive Room migrations.** Always add an explicit `MIGRATION_X_Y` in `DatabaseModule.kt`. The schema files in `android/schemas/` must stay in sync.
2. **Zero billing guardrail.** Do not import Firestore, Cloud Functions, Firebase Storage, or Firebase Realtime Database. The build has a custom task that fails CI if these appear.
3. **Firebase used only for:** Authentication, Crashlytics, Remote Config, Analytics — all free-tier only.
4. **Notifications fire only when the meal slot is not yet logged.** `shouldPostMealAlarm()` in `NotificationAlarmReceiver` enforces this; don't bypass it.
5. **AlarmManager, not WorkManager, for notifications.** WorkManager is only used for `SyncWorker`. The three old notification workers are deleted — do not re-add them.
6. **Never delete system food rows during re-seed.** `DatabaseSeeder` uses upsert-only strategy to preserve FK references from `meal_foods` and `logged_foods`.
7. **`planned_slots` is the source of truth for day planning.** When loading a day, read `planned_slots` first; fall back to `day_plans.template_diet_id`'s `diet_slots` only for slots not yet in `planned_slots`.

---

## Testing conventions
- **TDD when adding features** — write the failing test first, then implement.
- **Unit tests** live in `android/src/test/` and run on the JVM (no emulator needed).
- **Instrumented DAO tests** live in `android/src/androidTest/` using an in-memory Room database.
- Run all unit tests locally: `./gradlew :android:testDebugUnitTest`

### Test patterns used throughout the codebase
```kotlin
// Coroutine dispatcher — use @BeforeClass, not @Before, to avoid re-setting per test
@BeforeClass fun setUpClass() { Dispatchers.setMain(UnconfinedTestDispatcher()) }

// Mock singletons (objects) with mockkObject — always unmock in @After
mockkObject(NotificationPreferences)
coEvery { NotificationPreferences.setBreakfastHour(context, any()) } just Runs
// ...
unmockkObject(NotificationPreferences)

// Test flows with Turbine
viewModel.uiState.test {
    assertEquals(expected, awaitItem())
    cancelAndIgnoreRemainingEvents()
}
```

---

## Notification system (AlarmManager)
- **5 alarm types** defined in `NotificationAlarmType` enum (BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, STREAK, WEEKLY_PLAN)
- Each has a stable `requestCode` (1–5) used as `PendingIntent` identity for cancel/replace
- Alarms are one-shot (`setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`); receiver re-schedules next occurrence after each fire
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission required on API 31+; Settings screen shows a banner if not granted
- `NotificationAlarmBootstrapper.scheduleAll(context)` is the single entry point for (re-)scheduling everything
- Hour + minute precision: both stored in DataStore, both shown in the Settings time picker

---

## CI pipeline
Single `ci.yml` orchestrator. Runs **only on push to main**.

1. `detect-changes` (5 s) — dorny/paths-filter decides which modules changed
2. `android` job — only if `android/**` or `shared/**` changed. Uses `--build-cache --parallel`. **No `--configuration-cache`** — blocked by `verifyNoBillableFirebaseFeatures` task capturing a `Project` reference.
3. `backend` job — only if `backend/**` changed. `--configuration-cache` is safe here.
4. `ios` job — only if `ios/**` or `shared/**` changed. Caches Xcode DerivedData to cut warm builds from ~11 min to ~3-4 min.
5. `backend-deploy.yml` — separate file, deploys to Cloud Run on backend changes to main.

## Health Connect integration

MealPlan+ integrates with **Android Health Connect** (free, no cloud costs) to pull activity data from connected fitness watches (Garmin via Garmin Connect, Fitbit, Samsung Galaxy Watch, Polar, etc.).

### Data flow
```
Fitness watch  →  vendor companion app  →  Health Connect (local store)
                                              ↓
                                   HealthConnectManager (SDK reads)
                                              ↓
                                   HealthConnectRepository
                                         ↙          ↘
                              HomeViewModel        SettingsViewModel
                          (activity strip in        (connect / sync
                           home header)              weight → Health)
```

### What is synced
| Data | Record type | Where shown |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Steps today | `StepsRecord` | Home screen activity strip |
| Calories burned today | `TotalCaloriesBurnedRecord` | Home screen activity strip |
| Latest weight (last 30 days) | `WeightRecord` | Auto-logged to Health screen (once per day) |

### Permissions
Three read-only permissions declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `android.permission.health.READ_STEPS`
- `android.permission.health.READ_TOTAL_CALORIES_BURNED`
- `android.permission.health.READ_WEIGHT`

Permission is requested via `PermissionController.createRequestPermissionResultContract()` in `SettingsScreen`. The `MainActivity` declares `ACTION_SHOW_PERMISSIONS_RATIONALE` intent-filter so Health Connect can show our app in its permission management UI.

### Key classes
- `HealthConnectManager` — `@Singleton`, direct SDK calls (availability, permissions, reads)
- `HealthConnectRepository` — `@Singleton`, safe wrapper (returns empty/defaults when unavailable)
- `ActivitySummary` — data class carrying steps + calories burned + `isConnected` flag
- `HomeViewModel.loadActivityData()` — fetches on init and refresh
- `SettingsViewModel.checkHealthConnectStatus()` — checks connection, syncs weight, called on resume

### Availability
- Android 14+ (API 34): Health Connect is part of the OS — always available.
- Android 9–13: user must install the Health Connect app from Play Store. The Settings screen shows an "Install" prompt if unavailable.
